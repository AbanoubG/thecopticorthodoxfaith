Icons: All icons have been created by Copticchurch-library.org
Can I Use The Free Icons In My Projects ?

Icons can be used in a commercial project. However you would have to add a link to our website and state that the icons were created by copticchurch-library.org. In a personal project such an application or website it is fine if you need to use them.
